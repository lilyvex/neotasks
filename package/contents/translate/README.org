** Adding translations
Fill out [[template.pot][template.pot]] with your translations then open a [[https://github.com/lilyvex/neotasks/issues/new][new issue]],
name the file with the extension =.txt=, attach the txt file to the issue (drag and drop).

Or if you know how to make a pull request:

Copy the [[template.pot][template.pot]] file to [[./po][./po]] directory and name it your locale's code (Eg: =en= / =de= / =fr=) with the
extension =.po=. Then fill out all of the =msgstr ""=.

** Tooling
Ensure dependencies have been installed from your distrobution's package manager or =pip= / =uv=. They can be found [[requirements.txt][here]].

- =make update_locales= will parse the =i18n()= calls in the =*.qml= files and write it to the =template.pot= file.
  Then it will merge any changes into the =*.po= language files.

- =make build= will build the Plasmoid including the locale files, this is done by converting the =*.po= files to their binary =*.mo= version
  and moving them to =contents/locale/...=

- =make clean= will remove produced build artifacts
